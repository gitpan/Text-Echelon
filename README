This is Text::Echelon. It provides random Echelon "spook words".

Also included in this distribution is echelon.pl - a small script that can
be used to generate X-Echelon headers for your mail. 

To use it with mutt, put the following line in your .muttrc:

If you know how to set it up for use with other mail clients, please let me
know and I shall add your instructions to this distribution.
